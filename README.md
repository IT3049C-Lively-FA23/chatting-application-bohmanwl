## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
This assignment was pretty straight forward however I still had some issues towards the end. I enjoyed the HTML/CSS portion of the project, I know it was not the main focus
but its nice to know how the HTML logic works with the JS to create the application. Regarding why I lose points; my HTML, CSS, and updating messages all work fine but I believe
there may still be issues with sending messages. The messages dont update until after I've reopened the application. Also I'm not sure why npm test is "skipping" 1 of the tests. 
The application seems to be working for the most part so I assume theres just an error somewhere.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 2 hours.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
display-4 is like a preset fontsize and line placement that can be used for primary headers.
